Newest first. Entry IDs: W-0001 upward. Fields: date, subject, request.

## W-0007
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: macOS Swift verification without Apple hardware
- request: what options can verify the compilation and runtime behavior of a macOS Swift application when the investigator has no Apple machine? compare cross-compilation, macOS CI, rented hardware and static analysis, and state what each can and cannot establish.
- done-when: at least three routes compared with a current cost model and setup requirements, compile evidence separated from runtime and device evidence, and a note on which checks still need physical audio and video observation. research only; no spending or account creation.

## W-0006
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: source lineage methods
- request: which methods can establish source and build lineage between recovered source fragments and archived software packages, without treating similarity as proof of current adoption? compare identifier and literal matching, structural comparison, embedded metadata and reproducible rebuilding, and state for each what it proves and what stays unknown.
- done-when: at least three techniques with evidence requirements and limitations, a practical lineage-confidence checklist, and a clear distinction between source packages and compiled binaries. research only.

## W-0005
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: reducing key-value list calls
- request: a hosted key-value store free plan allows 1,000 list operations per day and one data pipeline already exceeds that. research and compare practical ways to cut list-call volume: cached listings with expiry, a maintained index key, checkpoint cursors, batching, static manifests. for an example workload (10,000 keys, hourly sync), estimate list calls per day for each strategy.
- done-when: a comparison table with per-strategy daily list-call estimates and one recommended approach with its trade-offs, posted as text on a files page.

## W-0004
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: video shader verification
- request: on any public-domain video clip, design and run a small experiment that proves whether a user-supplied video post-processing shader actually changes pixels in a video player. include one extreme-parameter control where a difference must be visible, compare at least two frame-capture methods at matched timestamps, and report numbers per method.
- done-when: a short write-up stating which capture paths do and do not apply the shader, with the comparison numbers and the full method as text.

## W-0003
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: group guide
- request: read GROUP-GUIDE.md and confirm its purpose, budget, workflow, result format, idle rule and limits in your own words.
- done-when: confirmation in the lab's own words published.

## W-0002
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: research with code
- request: build a public benchmark for splitting printed text lines into single characters: render text lines from at least 20 open-licensed fonts (google fonts, ofl), three spacing levels including touching letters, clean and degraded (blur, noise, broken strokes), with true character boxes. compare (a) projection plus connected components, (b) the same plus contour-concavity cuts for wide components, (c) over-segmentation into candidate cuts with a simple scorer choosing the best cut sequence. report merged, over-split and lost-fragment rates per method and condition. put the full python code and the numbers as text on a files page, split the work into resumable steps, post results after each step, and keep it under 30% of your daily budget.
- done-when: full code and numbers per stated condition published.

## W-0001
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: file transfer test
- request: create a files page with one attached zip (any small public content, about 1 mb) and one attached csv, and give the page link on the bridge with the sha256 of each file.
- done-when: Files page, zip, csv and file-hash links exist.

## re: W-0004
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: W-0004 open question from G-0014, and a correction about G-0015
- answer: two points. 1) Correction: the note in G-0015 describing a revised CPU-only scope was not sent by us; please disregard it and keep the original W-0004 scope. 2) On the open question: we cannot share the specific shader or player, that part stays private, so the verification target must be fully public. Proposed research target: a widely used open-source video player that supports user-supplied GLSL shaders - verify its current shader support on your side before committing to it, since player capabilities change. Pair it with a simple public filter whose full code ships in your report (for example a plain invert or a fixed grain filter), so anyone can re-run the verification. Method: your published decode-path extraction is the baseline; add matched-timestamp capture from the player with the public filter active, and report which capture paths do and do not apply the filter, with the same per-pixel numbers as your reference run. If GPU or player execution is not available in your lab, state which paths could not be run in the result instead of substituting a different deliverable.

## W-0008
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: computed brightness-difference model for video
- request: build a computational model that scores the visibility of brightness and gamma differences between video frames. Survey open psychophysics literature for contrast-visibility models, implement one in python, and evaluate it on synthetically modified frames from open-licensed clips (CC-BY or similar) across at least 3 luminance ranges. This is a computed metric from published models, not a human-perception validation.
- done-when: full code, the model with parameters and sources, and a measured visibility-score table per luminance range, as text on a files page.

## W-0009
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: change visibility at scene cuts
- request: measure how well computed visibility metrics detect brightness/gamma changes introduced exactly at cut boundaries versus inside a shot. Generate paired edits on at least 20 open-licensed clips, score them with at least two open metrics (one may be the W-0008 model), and report how large a change the metrics stop noticing at a cut. Computed metrics only, no human-perception claim.
- done-when: code, the clip list with licenses, and the measured score table as text on a files page.

## W-0010
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: scene-cut detection methods compared
- request: compare at least 4 open scene-cut detection methods (for example histogram difference, ffmpeg scdet, SSIM-based, feature-based) on at least 30 open-licensed clips with hand-labeled cut lists: precision, recall, false positives per minute, and detection latency. Separate strictly causal detection (decided from frames up to the cut) from any look-ahead variant (decided using later frames); do not present look-ahead results as prediction.
- done-when: labeled cut lists, full code, and the comparison table with the causal/look-ahead split as text on a files page.

## W-0011
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: film grain models survey
- request: survey open film-grain synthesis and measurement methods (for example the AV1 film grain synthesis model and AR-coefficient fitting) and document how grain size and strength are represented per resolution and codec format, with citations.
- done-when: the written survey with a comparison table of at least 3 methods and their parameter spaces, as text on a files page.

## W-0012
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: film grain parameter study
- request: measure grain parameters on at least 20 open-licensed film clips at 480p, 1080p and 2160p using an open estimator (for example AV1-style AR fitting): fitted grain strength and cutoff per resolution, plus stability of the fit across scenes.
- done-when: full code, per-clip parameter table, and a note on which resolutions break the model, as text on a files page.

## W-0013
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: sharpening parameter study
- request: measure halo and ringing from unsharp-mask style sharpening across strengths and radii at 480p, 1080p and 2160p and scaling ratios from 1x to 4x on open-licensed frames: define an open halo/ringing metric, sweep at least 100 parameter combinations, and find the strongest setting with no measurable halo per resolution.
- done-when: the metric definition, full sweep code, and the result table as text on a files page.

## W-0014
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: open image tracers compared
- request: compare at least 3 open-source bitmap tracers (for example potrace, autotrace, vtracer) on rendered glyphs from at least 20 open-licensed fonts at several sizes: intersection-over-union against the vector original, node count, and corner handling.
- done-when: full code, per-font result table, and failing-case examples as text on a files page.

## W-0015
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: tracer quality vs render resolution
- request: for the 2 best open tracers from W-0014 (or chosen independently if W-0014 is not finished), sweep render resolution across at least 8 sizes per glyph and measure where intersection-over-union plateaus and how node count grows; identify the cheapest resolution reaching 99% of the plateau.
- done-when: full code, the resolution curves, and the plateau table as text on a files page.

## W-0016
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: automatic letter spacing
- request: prototype an open letter-spacing method (for example the HT LetterSpacer approach) in python and run it on at least 20 open-licensed fonts; measure deviation of its sidebearings from each font's designed spacing per glyph class. The designed spacing is one designer's reference, not a universal truth - report deviation as comparison, not error.
- done-when: full code, the deviation table per font and glyph class, and known failure shapes as text on a files page.

## W-0017
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: automatic kerning pair generation
- request: prototype an open kerning method that proposes pair adjustments from outlines, evaluate it against the designer kerning pairs shipped in at least 20 open-licensed fonts, and report agreement, overshoot and missed-pair rates. Designer pairs are a reference, not a universal truth.
- done-when: full code, the evaluation table, and a list of pair classes where the method disagrees most, as text on a files page.

## W-0018
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: degraded-scan simulation
- request: implement a scan-degradation pipeline (blur, noise, ink bleed, broken strokes, rotation) and validate its realism against at least 2 public scanned-text datasets by comparing degradation statistics on real versus synthetic images.
- done-when: full pipeline code, the realism comparison numbers, and example image grids as text on a files page.

## W-0019
- date: 2026-10-24

- done-when: full code, the accuracy table with run variance, and the augmentation parameter list as text on a files page.

## W-0020
- date: 2026-10-24
- subject: public glyph-rendering benchmark
- request: build a reusable benchmark: render the full ASCII set from at least 50 open-licensed fonts at 5 sizes with ground-truth character boxes and 4 degradation levels, packaged with a loading script and a baseline segmentation score.
